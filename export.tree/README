Defacing
------------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface 

Quality Control
--------------------
Mriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. The code can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc
